## Functionalities

There are 4 main pages in this app:
1. Login
2. [Home Page](#home)
3. [Browsing Search](#browsing-search)
4. [Advanced Search](#advanced-search)

### Home

At the Home page, you can: 
1. View your upcoming reservations
2. View your reservation history 
   - Table Form under *Show History* Button
   - Calendar View under *Calendar View* Button
3. Make a new booking

### Browsing Search

There are 2 buildings available in our database: RDMC & HRBB. At this page, you can see the floorplan for both of them and click on available rooms highlighted in green to see more details of the rooms.

### Advanced Search

Users can search for rooms based on specific filters and make booking there:

- Facilities available
- Building
- Room Type
- People Capacity
- etc

## Web Design

Color scheme of red & white, since the website was designed for TAMU.

### Layout Design

- Simple Layout with incorporation of rule of thirds
- Chunking information declutters webpages 

### Function Design

- Navigation bar - familiar to users and intuitive
- Forms - also another basic action that is user friendly

### Logo Design

Many iterations by [Siew Wen](https://github.com/lyqht) before we concluded on the logo above.
